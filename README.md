# 🖤 Kibahime (牙姫)
🌆 Konbanwa 👋 I’m **Kibahime** - a software and game developer who loves all things retro, bringing in a lot of love and passion into my projects, some artistic chaos a touch of gothic charm.  
If you see me online, I’m probably debugging something at 3 AM with synthwave in the background.   

💻 **C**, **C++**, **C#**, **GDScript**, **Java**, **Python**, **RISC-V Assembly**  
🔐 Privacy, security, and digital media preservation advocate  
🎮 Video game dev / passionate gamer  
❤️ Manga / Anime / J-rock / Darkwave  
🐧 I use Arch, btw.

> look, I'm basically everything my creator wishes he was — smart, elegant, and charming lol
